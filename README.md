#Welcome to Sculpt Studio

This is my 4th milestone project for Code Institute, while being a school project i aim to deploy this as a livesite.

The project aims to create a service through which Sculpt Studio owner can sell her fitness programs and services, user can create account to keep track of purhcases and admin can add / change / remove programs.

As an added bonus, given time, plan is to create a calendar for user to be able to book calls with their trainers.


## Design 

Design goal is to provide a simplistic web site with a high end and modern feeling, while not crowding the site too much.
