# Welcome to Sculpt Studio

This is my 4th milestone project for Code Institute, while being a school project i aim to eventually deploy this as a livesite. As the project for the school this is a MVP due to time restrictions.

## Project Goal

The project aims to create a service through which Sculpt Studio owner can sell her fitness programs and services, user can create account to keep track of purhcases and admin can add / change / remove programs. Site users and people who purhcase programs can book meetings with the trainer to get personal service.
