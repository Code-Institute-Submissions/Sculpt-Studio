To make admin users work easier they are able to manage all users by logging in and going on their account. There they can deactivate users, add users as superusers and see details about users that would make it easier for them to do their work on the website without using Admin portal. Then of course in the admin portal users with superuser access have access to the entire site info, such as purchases, users, testimonials etc. 
For testing purposes Admin user has been created: 
User: newadmin
